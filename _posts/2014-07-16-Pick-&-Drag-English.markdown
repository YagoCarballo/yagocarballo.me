description: The App contains 800 phrasal verbs (PV) divided into 4 levels of difficulty.<br /><br />It's a complementary tool for English students designed to improve the learning of the PV.<br /><br />The aim of the App is to review PV, so you will be asked randomly at your level, and sometimes at the previous level.<br /><br />One PV can have several meanings, and each meaning could be at a different level.<br /><br />Up to 3 users can compete with each other.<br /><br />You could be asked either of the preposition or the verb of the PV.<br /><br />The sentence with a space for one of 8 prepositions (or 6 verbs) around it will appear. All you have to do is to drag the correct preposition or verb to the sentence.<br /><br />The correct answer scores 1 point and each mistake subtracts 0.25 point, and you have 3 chances to get the correct answer. When you reach 40 points you can go to a higher level.<br /><br />After the answers you can see the PV and its meaning at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />At the end, you can find a table with all playersâ€™ scores.<br /><br /><a href="http://pickdragenglish.com">Pick & Drag English Website</a>
